## By: Clare Garberg, Stephanie Plaza, Amalia Stahl, Kajal Tiwary

### Abstract

This research uses all Reddit activity data, including posts and comments on posts, from January 2021 to August 2022 to extract valuable business insights for Glossier, a cosmetics brand primarily in the e-commerce space. Ten granular business questions, broken down by consumer, demand, product, and competition, are explored and answered using NLP and ML techniques using Spark in Azure Databricks. Sentiment analysis as well as topic modeling with LDA is conducted to inform future product strategy. External data (Google search and Covid data) is incorporated as well to determine if sentiment can be predicted. This project is important as it serves as an example of analysis for companies looking to gain a greater market share that does not include easily accessible customer tracking data purchased from third parties. Most importantly, Glossier will have insights to determine the most optimal launch and marketing strategies in the midst of their high growth and physical presence expansion.
