    "Takeaways: The above density plot, maps the individual distributions for Glossier google search trends and its 3 main competitors. While Fenty and Glossier seem to have a similar right skewed density distributions with a clear peak, the Ulta and Sephora density distributions do not. From this result, it seems that Glossier and Fenty searches tend to be more consistent, meaning they hover around a similar number of searches versus Sephora and Ulta seem to have a lot more variabilty. We plan to build off of this EDA and determine wether google search trends are correlated to overall subreddit activity. "

    "Takeaways: The above time series plot depics the normalized amount of searches for the term Glossier over time. Clearly there are spikes in the data which as expected seem to track with typically high sales periods (such as christmas and 4th of July) for retail and cosmetics brands. The March 2021 spike seemed like anamoly but after some reasearch it became clear that a promo code, allowing anyone to buy Glossier products for 50% off, went viral and created lots of interest in the brand. This could potentially explain the spike in search terms."
