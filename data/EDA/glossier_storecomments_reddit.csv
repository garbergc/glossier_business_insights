Stockholm! they have been shipping to us for a while and had a pop up thing in Copenhagen so Im crossing my fingers :)
need one in toronto
I'd love for them to reopen new york :(
I think a glossier store in Edinburgh would be beautiful
Washington D.C!
Chicago!
Stockholm
I can picture a cute one in San Francisco
"Purely for my own selfish reasons, I'd like one in Denver and I desperately want them to re-open the one in New York."
I think Glossier would make a lot of sense in Vancouver as most girls there fit the effortless cool girl vibe
Charleston SC!!
Philadelphia
Stockholm!
Bordeaux in France! 
Boston. I know they had a pop up but I MISSED it:(
"Portland, OR would be a good pop up !! I know there is glossier Seattle but if they ever got rid of that pop-up Portland would be another good destination. Scottsdale, AZ would be another good place for a pop-up too! Maybe Denver, CO? "
"Austin, TX! they did a pop up there a few years back and it was super cool"
Paris ?? Somewhere in France please..
Dallas or Houston.
Washington DC!
baltimore or washington Dc. probably DC since it's a little nicer. there needs to be something in the middle for the southern states ( and ofc close to me in maryland lol)
"Dublin, ireland!"
"San Juan, Puerto Rico"
"neeeed toronto, would also love to apply to work there"
Copenhagen!!
"I think Boston has a good demographic, I also think architecturally it would be really cool"
San Diego!
Montreal!
"Cincinnati, everywhere else is so far away from where I live lol"
I live in London but I could see Paris doing well with their minimal/multi use makeup habits
Chicago!
sam francisco!
boston
miami
Paris
new orleans would be so cool !
I want it in my uk city. It's boring everything being in London
nashville :)) except they'd more than likely put it near 5th and broadway or the gulch and that makes me go :(((((
montreal!!!!!!
HOUSTON
"i think a store in Savannah could be really cool, especially with SCAD being right there. i feel like they could rlly thrive with the SCAD demographic, u know?

(… also my dad lives like half an hour from savannah and i’m selfish)"
Pittsburgh please
San Fransisco
"New orleans! I feel like they could do a really cool theme in the store there and the LE item could be something really fun and creative since there's so much culture in Nola

They could partner with a place like cafe du monde"
NYC!
minneapolis
Chicago needs some love!
"I've thought about this a lot especially after the Austin, TX pop up, but either Dallas or Houston and doing cowboy themed things! Like a bolo tie with the G would be so cute"
Hawaii maybe?
Boston baby!!!
I feel like they need a store in the heartland of the USA. Maybe Nashville?!
"Since there's a permanent store in Miami this probably won't happen but Orlando. They could have a lot of oranges. A pale orange with glossier pink would be chefs kiss. Have a cute lemonade stand next door. If they opened a pop up at Disney springs, they could do some cool Disney merch with Daisy and Minnie or maybe even the princess. Disney has been leaning into the pastel color Minnie ears so it's up their ally."
somewhere in canada that isnt vancouver/toronto loll
Some place in Florida
Atlanta!!
Hong Kong!!!! There's so much demand here for Glossier
Toronto and that's a fact
i'm thinking of Paris and they'll have a macaron flavored BDC collab with Laduree
Vancouver!!!
"Salt Lake City, Utah in the United States. I would gladly make a trip there to get make up from glossier."
Scottsdale/Phoenix would be all desert-y and dreamy.
Miami!
dallas.. only bc that's the closest big city to me
They were working on one in Phoenix/Scottsdale when Covid hit. This is why skywash has desert themed names. It was going to be at the same mall that Jake Paul broke into during the riots.
"St. Louis, but if not here then Chicago!"
"Not gonna lie, I would redo my London one as I feel the ball was dropped both decor & merch wise

Idea 1- Make the whole place look like a cute underground station, train style seating/photo areas with red seats & pink handrails that look like the inside of a train carriage, a large tunnel shaped mirror & fake pink escalators, cute direction signs, artwork on the floor and walls to recreate the lines of the underground map using glossier colours and of course an underground logo saying glossier & a red umbrella art installation

Idea 2- A traditional tea room with a bold modern art twist (to honour the old aristo/period drama culture and newer cosmpolitan culture). Patterned flooring, walls filled with bold pop art style decorative plates, decorative books, some paintings inspired by fashion culture, vintage films, royalty etc. Make the products look like knick knacks on a wooden red shelves. Soft pink armchairs, oval tables, some products on cake stands, a large pink phonebox you can take photos in

And I would've made the free item either a tea flask/coffee mug, tumbler cup, teacup & saucer set, knitted blanket or a foldable umbrella this time."
"Oslo, snow globe"
"im from Tucson, AZ and a desert theme would be so cute!! a glossier pink adobe exterior with biiiig wooden front doors, lots of wood/saguaro wood, concrete floors, iron accents!! maybe some kind of cacti display like what Seattle's location has,,, as for special merch item, i think a baseball hat! because its so sunny here, you need to protect your face from the sun! or maybe a battery powered fan?"
"It should have the vibe of an abandoned steel mill, smell like brackish water, and come with a complimentary pink ""G"" branded crab mallet.

Old Bay BDC: orange tint with red sparkles"
"Gothenburg, a lingonberry themed balm dotcom would be nice"
"I live in the Central Valley of California, which is where most of the almond farmers live. I would want a snow globe that has almond blossoms flying around inside, instead of snow. Late winter/early spring is hell for my allergies, but it's so pretty that it's worth it."
"I'm in Vancouver, Canada where it rains A LOT. a cute pocket/purse-sized pink umbrella as a merch would be ideal! And maybe a maple-flavoured balm dot com?"
"i live in nashville, tn and i think they could do something fun with a whole music city theme!! not sure how they would do it but i feel like it could be so cute!! they should have a painted mural on the building like we have all across the city and for the special items maybe pink glossier nashville shirts with a lil glossier guitar on it or a glossier pink cowgirl boot keychain or something!!! idk but i just really wish we had a store in nashville, it would do so well here."
"i realize that miami was already art deco, but given that f scott fitzgerald is from saint paul, i feel like an art deco theme would be SO cute in the minneapolis/saint paul area. or, since the state fair is so big here, maybe like a cute carnival theme? we also have a lot of breweries here, so some sort of glass might be a good piece of merch"
Mafia themed.
Anyone know what the theme for the Brooklyn store will be?
"portland, umbrella or an actual good coffee mug"
"Seattle, we already have a store but the water bottle is so ugly. Why didn't they make it the cute glossier pink instead of a booger green nalgene?? I also wished they did a coffee mug or umbrella instead of a water bottle, since Seattle is known for coffee and rain. I know Seattle people don't use umbrellas but I think a pink umbrella would be cute!"
I think the obvious merch for Toronto would be a toque!
"Chicago, pink deep dish pizza  But like actually a little pink bean keychain might be cute"
Albuquerque... no idea on special merch but the ideal theme would probably be chile and hot air balloons lol.
"I'd love to see some more UK stores - I feel like one in Oxford would be nice, there's so much inspiration to be had from the gothic architecture of some of the university buildings! And either a mug or potentially even a sort of collegiate style hoodie for the merch, again taking inspo from the university aspect"
"Upper Peninsula of Michigan, I would hope the special merch would be like a pink pompom logo beanie for how much snow we get or even better would be a snow jumpsuit, pink with red logo and details."
"Yeah they're never coming to Asbury Park.

"Charlotte, NC, I guess like nascar but cute? Or the mountains/hiking? (I love my city but it has no unique culture)"
"Orlando, I would do special glossier Minnie ears and a shirt with Mickey wearing a glossier shirt or something
Man y'all Disney haters. Thought it would be cute"
Singapore and definitely some tropical theme!
"Singapore, and make it an Orchid Garden theme maybe they can release a limited edition orchid flavour balm dot com!"
salt lake city and the merch could be a beanie or baseball cap!
"Denver, an outdoorsy/mountains theme would be so cute!"
